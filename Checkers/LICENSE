                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program, to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it, and that you can change the software and use it
privately or publicly without having to pay royalties or fees.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the software, whether
modified or not, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms
that you received.  You must make sure that everyone else also
receives or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer this License
giving everyone else the permission to use it under these terms.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For example, if the
program is defective, the author offers no repair or replacement.  You
are encouraged to distribute the software to others, but if you do so
you must pass on the same risks that you took on.  This includes,
for example, the risks that the software is defective or incompatible
with other software or hardware, or that it infringes someone else's
rights.

  Finally, the GPL is designed to be simple and easy to understand.
Everyone is permitted to use it, and it is available in many languages.
If you have questions about the license or about how to apply it, you
can find answers on the GNU website, in the GNU General Public License
FAQ, and in many other places.

  The above is only a preamble.  It does not legally bind you or
anyone else.  The terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License
follow this preamble.  Be sure to read and understand these terms and
conditions.  They are the rules that govern how you can use, modify,
and distribute the software.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like rights such as those
applicable to similar protective rights in other countries.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensor" refers to
the individual, individuals, or entity that offers you the Program
under these terms.

1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  The Program, and any derivative works, must be distributed in
source code form.  The source code must be accompanied by a copy of
this License, and by a copyright notice.  The source code must be
the preferred form for making modifications, and must be open to
the public for inspection.  It must allow the user to generate
the object code.

  The source code for the Program is available from the copyright
holder.  You may also find it in the GNU repository, or on other
free software sites.

2. Basic Permissions.

  You are permitted to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Program,
either as received or as modified by you, under the terms of this
License.  These permissions are granted for any purpose, including
commercial purposes, and without any fee or royalty.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted
by this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee,
royalty, or other charge for exercise of the rights granted under
this License, and you may not require acceptance of additional
terms and conditions.

3. Copyleft.

  You may not distribute copies of the Program or modifications of it
that you make, except as expressly provided under this License.
You must pass on to recipients the same rights that you received.
You must distribute the source code for the Program or your
modifications to it, and you must keep intact all notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty.

  If you distribute the Program or your modifications, you must do so
under the terms of this License.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the rights granted by this License.

4. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the conditions
of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
Program shall be listed in the "Additional Permissions" section
of this License.

  You may not add the Program to a collection of other programs
without including the source code for the Program or your
modifications to it.

5. No Warranty.

  The Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind,
either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
the Program is with you.

  Should the Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all
necessary servicing, repair, or correction.  You agree that you will
not hold the authors or copyright holders liable for any damages
arising from your use of the Program.

6. Limitation of Liability.

  In no event will the authors or copyright holders be liable to you
for any damages, including any general, special, incidental, or
consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use
the Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data
being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third
parties or a failure of the Program to operate with any other
programs), even if such authors or copyright holders have been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

7. Interpreting the License.

  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if you have a proprietary extension that you cannot
distribute as a part of the Program, then you may not distribute
the Program at all.

  However, if the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which
future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author under this version.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "About box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
